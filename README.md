# client-server-architecture
About - This repository holds the source code for our Client-Server Architecture Coursework

Setup guide to run the project
1) Download the 'client-server-architecture' github repository and extract the ZIP file
2) There are 2 projects (Web Client & Web Server), import both of them into NetBeans
3) Run the "Web Client" project (the default username is 'root' & password is 'root123')

The Web Client & Web Server projects are right now independent of each other and I have still not made the Web Client connect to and use the web services of the Web Server project. The Web Server has 2 web services, CustomerWebService & EmployeeWebService. Once the web services are properly completed then we can go ahead and use these services via the web client.

Note - Fork this repository, dabble with the code. If you think that some UI design changes need to be done tell me. If you make any changes send me a pull request for original repository.
